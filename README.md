# Calculator
## This is a calculator with the basic operations of :
*   Addition
*   Subtraction
*   Division
*   Multiplication

The calculator performs operations on 2 operands at a time.
User is allowed to enter more operators after the first operation is completed using the '='/'enter' key.

## This project utilises the following technologies:
*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JAVASCRIPT

Multiple display for first operand, second operand, operator wasn't a great decision.
Lots of excess code for boxing in to any further enhancements.
Simpler design would have been better.
